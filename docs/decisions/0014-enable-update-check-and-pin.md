# Enable/disable, update-check, and pin extend the same model

*Applies to: [Content & modpacks](../architecture/content.md)*

Beyond add/list/remove/update, an installed item carries an `enabled` flag
(`content.json`, defaulting true so old records decode enabled) toggled by
`server|instance.content.enable`. Disabling is enforced at the *single* point
the flag needs: the launch-time mirror `sync` treats a disabled item like a
profile non-member — kept out of `data/` — so a disabled mod is never loaded and
a backup restore can't resurrect it; the toggle also applies the filesystem
change immediately (the entry is stopped) so the state is visible before the
next start. A datapack has no mirror, so it disables by the standard `.disabled`
rename inside its world (Minecraft ignores the suffix), which the world backup
carries. `content.check_updates` is a *separate* on-demand call (not baked into
`list`): it resolves each platform item's newest compatible version upstream and
reports which differ, keeping `list` fast and offline. `content.set_version`
re-pins one item to a chosen published version — the update path with an
explicit pin instead of "newest" — as a `ContentManager` job like `update`. All
three refuse a running or busy entry, matching the existing content ops. The
desktop reaches every content operation through the generic bridge; a local-file
import uses `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s native picker to hand the daemon a real
daemon-readable path (a webview `File` has none).
