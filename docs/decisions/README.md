# Design decisions

Every non-trivial architectural choice in Hestia, recorded next to the reason it
was made — what changed, what it replaced, and what was rejected. The
[architecture](../architecture.md) pages describe *what the system is*; these
describe *why it is that*.

Each entry is one decision, numbered in the order it was written down, and links
back to the subsystem page it explains. The numbering stays contiguous: a
superseded decision is rewritten in place, and one whose feature is removed is
deleted with the rest renumbered behind it, so the list never has holes in it.

**Adding one:** when you make a call that a future reader would otherwise have to
reverse-engineer, add a file here (`NNNN-kebab-title.md`, next number free), open
with an *Applies to* line pointing at its subsystem page, and list it below. State
the alternative you rejected — that is usually the part nobody can recover later.
