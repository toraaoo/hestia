# win.ps1 — run the scripts/ dev flow on Windows from PowerShell.
#
# Every verb forwards to the matching scripts/<verb>.sh, so the shell scripts
# stay the single source of truth (no duplicated packaging logic) and adding one
# needs nothing here — the verbs are discovered, never listed. Two things
# PowerShell owns natively rather than delegating to Git Bash: stopping every
# running hestiad before a build (a live hestiad.exe hard-locks the .exe cargo
# is about to overwrite), and the interactive `dev` subshell — bare
# `win.ps1 dev` drops you into PowerShell, not `bash -i`.
#
# Requires Git for Windows (bash.exe) for the forwarded verbs. WSL's bash is
# intentionally skipped: it runs a Linux userland that can't see the Windows
# cargo target. Bare `dev` is pure PowerShell and needs only cargo.
