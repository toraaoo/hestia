/**
 * The fixture job driver. A long-running daemon operation answers its start
 * call immediately and settles later on `<family>.done`; the client's `runJob`
 * blocks until that event arrives, so a job that never publishes one hangs the
 * caller forever. This walks a plan on a timer, publishes a progress event per
 * tick, and settles — cancellably, since `job.cancel` must be able to reach it.
 *
 * `done` is a thunk rather than a value: what a done event reports (the entry
 * a create minted, the pack an install landed) is mutated when the job
 * finishes, not when it starts.
