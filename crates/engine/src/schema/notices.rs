//! Where a quarantined document goes so that somebody other than the log finds
//! out about it.
//!
//! A quarantine is not the outcome of the operation that happened to trigger it
//! — a `server.list` does not *cause* one — so it cannot ride out on that
//! result the way an ordinary degraded outcome does
//! ([0029](../../../../docs/decisions/0029-degraded-outcomes-ride-on-the-result.md)).
//! What it does instead is disappear: the entry whose record was set aside stops
//! being listed, silently, which is the exact failure that decision exists to
//! prevent.
//!
//! So quarantines accumulate here, in one append-only sink per process, and are
//! read back through the surfaces where the user is already looking: the daemon
//! status, and the result of an import or a restore that produced one. The sink
//! is process-global rather than an engine member because a document is loaded
//! from free functions several layers below anything holding the aggregate, and
//! threading a handle through every store constructor to carry diagnostics would
//! cost more than it explains. `mark`/`since` scope a read to one operation
//! without the sink having to know operations exist.
