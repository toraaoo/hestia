//! NeoForge metadata, read from the upstream installer jar on
//! `maven.neoforged.net`.
//!
//! NeoForge publishes no metadata service — no Fabric-style profile endpoint and
//! no Mojang-style manifest. The truth for a version lives *inside* its
//! installer jar: `version.json` (the launch profile, a vanilla-shaped manifest
//! meant to be merged over the base game), `install_profile.json` (the libraries
//! and processors that produce a patched game jar), and `data/{client,server}.lzma`
//! (the binary patches those processors apply). All three are read in-process
//! through the `zip` crate, the same way a `.mrpack` index is.
//!
//! Modrinth's launcher reads a pre-processed copy of this from its own hosted
//! meta service; Hestia reads the installer directly, keeping the upstream-direct
//! rule every other flavor follows and taking libraries from NeoForged's own
//! maven with their own checksums. The *technique* below — resolving the data
//! table and running the processors — follows theseus.
