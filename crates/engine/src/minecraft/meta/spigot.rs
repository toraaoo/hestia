//! The SpigotMC hub: which versions BuildTools can build, and what each one
//! needs from the JVM.
//!
//! There is no jar here, deliberately — Mojang's takedown means neither Spigot
//! nor CraftBukkit may be redistributed, so the only artifact SpigotMC serves
//! is BuildTools itself and the jar is compiled locally (see
//! `minecraft::spigot`). This client is the catalogue half alone.
