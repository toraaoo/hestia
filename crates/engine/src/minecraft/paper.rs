//! The PaperMC server platforms — Paper and Folia. Both are one self-contained
//! jar per build, so a profile is the vanilla shape with the jar swapped; they
//! differ only in which project of the same service they read, and in that
//! Folia publishes far fewer versions.
//!
//! Neither has a client, so neither implements `InstanceProvider`: `instance
//! create --flavor paper` fails as an unknown instance flavor, which is the
//! truth.
//!
//! A *build* is what the flavor's `loader_version` names. Paper publishes many
//! builds per game version and a server operator routinely needs a specific one
//! — pinning a known-good build, or taking an experimental one deliberately —
//! so the existing loader-version seam carries it, exactly as Fabric's loader
//! builds do.
