//! The provider seams. A flavor implements the trait for its domain (server or
//! instance), listing the game versions it supports and resolving a request into
//! a full launch profile. The `Minecraft` aggregate holds a boxed registry of
//! each — adding a flavor is a new impl plus one line in `Minecraft::new`.
