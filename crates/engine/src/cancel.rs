//! Cooperative cancellation for long-running engine work.
//!
//! A job is cancelled **at safe checkpoints**, never by killing anything
//! mid-write. Every long operation here already writes through a staging
//! artifact and commits with a rename, so the checkpoints are the boundaries
//! that discipline already created: between files in a batch, between chunks of
//! a download, between phases of a pipeline. Stopping at one leaves exactly what
//! stopping there would have left had the network failed — which the failure
//! paths already handle, and which `Engine::recover()` reclaims.
//!
//! The token rides with the progress reporter rather than as a second parameter:
//! the two travel to the same places for the same reason, and a function that
//! reports progress is by definition one that can be cancelled.
