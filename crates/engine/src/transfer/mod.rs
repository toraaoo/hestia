//! Instance import and export — moving an instance in and out of the launcher
//! as a single file.
//!
//! This is the instance answer to what backups are for a server, and it is a
//! different shape on purpose: a server's data is archived *in place*, on a
//! schedule, because a server is infrastructure that has to be recoverable. An
//! instance is something you play, share, and move between machines, so its
//! archive is one portable file that says what it is.
//!
//! # Adding a format
//!
//! One module beside this one and one line in [`formats`]. A format answers
//! three questions and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. **which archives are mine** — a [`Format::MARKER`] file, matched by name;
//! 2. **what does this one say it is** — [`Format::read`], which parses the
//!    archive's own manifest into a [`Blueprint`];
//! 3. **where do the files go** — [`Format::land`], given an instance that now
//!    exists on disk.
//!
//! What a format never does is create the instance. That is the launcher's
//! job, and the [`Recipe`] a blueprint carries says which of the three ways to
//! do it applies — a resolved record travelling in the archive, a game version
//! and loader that still have to be resolved, or a pack the modpack flow owns
//! end to end. Those three are a closed set: the flow matches on the recipe,
//! not on the format, so a fourth format costs the flow nothing.
//!
//! Export is the same shape with fewer moving parts: [`ExportFormat`] picks a
//! writer, and the rules for what an archive leaves out are shared
//! ([`exclude`]) so two exporters cannot drift on the question of what an
//! instance's files actually are.
