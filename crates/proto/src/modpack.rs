//! Modpack contracts: installing a pack into a new or existing entry, what the
//! entry then records about the pack it runs, and moving that pack to another
//! published version.
//!
//! A pack is resolved through the ordinary content vocabulary
//! ([`crate::content::ResolvedModpack`]) and then *installed*: its index files
//! become ordinary managed content tagged `modpack:<name>`, while its
//! `overrides/` land straight in the entry's game directory. The two sides get
//! their own channels rather than one target-tagged channel, so the router's
//! account gate covers the instance half by prefix — the same split
//! `server.content.*` / `instance.content.*` already uses.
