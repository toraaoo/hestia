//! The canonical daemon warning — a degraded outcome of an operation that
//! nonetheless succeeded. Structured exactly like [`crate::error::ErrorInfo`]:
//! nobody authors prose at a call site, the English text (`Display`) is a
//! projection of the variant, and a front-end renders its own localized string
//! from the tag + typed fields.
//!
//! A warning exists because the alternative is a daemon log line, which the
//! person who ran the operation never sees — so an operation that half-worked
//! reported unqualified success. Anything the user would want to know about a
//! result belongs here, on the result.
//!
//! Every variant carries a [`WarningInfo::hint`] beside its headline: a
//! degraded outcome the user cannot act on is just noise, so the remediation is
//! part of the type rather than something each front-end invents.
