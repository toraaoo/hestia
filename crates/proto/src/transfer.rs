//! Instance import and export: moving an instance out of the launcher as a
//! single archive, and bringing one back — from hestia's own export or from
//! another launcher's.
//!
//! Export is the instance side of what backups are for a server, which is why
//! instances have no backup channels of their own. Import is deliberately
//! *format-detecting* rather than format-declared: the caller names a file, the
//! daemon reads its marker and answers with what it found, so a person who was
//! handed a `.mrpack` and a person who zipped a Prism instance both run the
//! same command.
//!
//! Both are jobs — an archive is an arbitrary number of files and an import may
//! download every mod a pack names — so the call answers with a job id and the
//! outcome arrives as an event, like every other long-running operation.
