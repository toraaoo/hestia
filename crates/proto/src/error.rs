//! The canonical daemon error — a structured, exhaustive value carried whole
//! across the socket. Nobody authors prose at a call site: the English text
//! (`Display`) and the coarse `code` are projections of the variant, and a
//! front-end renders its own localized string from the tag + typed fields.
//!
//! Semantic variants translate fully with their fields; operational variants
//! (`Io`, `Upstream`, `DownloadFailed`, `RconFailed`, `Internal`) carry an
//! unbounded English `detail` — a per-path filesystem message is not localizable
//! and is shown as secondary text under a translated headline.
